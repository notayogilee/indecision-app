# Indecision App

### There is nothing special about this app...

Well that may be true for the app, but not the creation of it - this app was created from scratch and
 not using create-react-app. So that means Babel, Webpack, and Sass were all configured manually which 
 was really cool and a good lesson on what happens under the hood with create-react-app.
