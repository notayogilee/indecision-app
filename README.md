# Indecision App
## From the course *The complete React Developer Course by Andrew Mead

### To install and use:
Clone the repository and install dependencies using 

npm install

Then run the command 

npm run dev-server

and go to localhost:8080

### There is nothing special about this app...

Well that's not really true, this app was created from scratch - not using create-react-app
So that means Babel, Webpack, and Sass were all configured manually which was really cool 
and a good lesson on what happens under the hood with create-react-app.
